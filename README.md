# 🎮 Connect Four Monte Carlo Simulation 

## 🚀 Introduction

### 📚 Project description
This project is an implementation of  the Monte Carlo search algorithm for the game of "Connect Four". 

Connect Four is a turn-based board game in which two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid alternatively.

The Monte Carlo search algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that uses random sampling and statistical analysis to find the best possible move in a game.

Connect Four is a great game for Monte Carlo search algorithms because it has a relatively simple set of rules and a finite number of possible game states. In fact,  this algorithm can be used to analyze the best possible moves for a player given the current game state. It does this by simulating many random games from the current state, and analyzing the outcomes of those simulations to determine the best possible move. This makes it a useful tool for creating AI opponents that can play Connect Four at a high level.

###  🎯 Project goals and objectives

In this project we will try to let an AI agent learn to play Connect 4 using Monte Carlo Search algorithms and evaluate its performance.
