# 🎮 Connect Four Monte Carlo Search

## 🚀 Introduction

### 📚 Project description
This project is an implementation of  the Monte Carlo search algorithm for the game of "Connect Four". 

Connect Four is a turn-based board game in which two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid alternatively.

The Monte Carlo search algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that uses random sampling and statistical analysis to find the best possible move in a game.

Connect Four is a great game for Monte Carlo search algorithms because it has a relatively simple set of rules and a finite number of possible game states. In fact,  this algorithm can be used to analyze the best possible moves for a player given the current game state. It does this by simulating many random games from the current state, and analyzing the outcomes of those simulations to determine the best possible move. This makes it a useful tool for creating AI opponents that can play Connect Four at a high level.

###  🎯 Project goals and objectives

In this project we will try to let an AI agent learn to play Connect 4 using Monte Carlo Search algorithms and evaluate its performance.

## ⚡️ Connect four
Connect Four is a classic game that has been around for over a century. However, it wasn't until 1974 that the game was officially licensed by Milton Bradley.

In October of 1988, James Dow Allen officially found a way for the first player to win the game every single time using his strategy. Other people and technologies have also solved this game.


### 📝 Rules of the game
Playing Connect Four requires following a simple set of rules:

1. Two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid.
2. The discs fall to the bottom of the grid or on top of other discs.
3. The objective is to connect four of the same colored discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
4. Players can only drop one disc at a time.
5. The game ends if there is a four-in-a-row, which means that a player needs to place their colored discs in a consecutive line of four either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on the game board.
6. The game ends too if there is no more moves can be made.
7. Players should alternate who goes first each game. For example, the first player of the first game will go second during the second game.

### 🏷️ Strategies of the game
There are several strategies that players can use to improve their chances of winning at Connect Four, including:

1. Select the middle column for a first move to maintain a strong central position.
2. Choose another bottom row slot with the second move.
3. Blocking the opponent's potential four-in-a-row while working towards your own.
4. Trying to create multiple threats at the same time to force the opponent to choose which to block.
5. Avoiding placing discs in the bottom row as this can limit future moves.
